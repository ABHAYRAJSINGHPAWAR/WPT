        C-DAC was created in November 1987,[3] initially as the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Technology (C-DACT).[4][3] In 1988, the US Government refused to sell India a Cray supercomputer due to concerns about India using it to develop nuclear weapons.[5] In response India started development of its own supercomputer, and C-DACT was created as part of this programme.[6][7]

        Dr Vijay Bhatkar was hired as the director of C-DACT.[7] The project was given an initial run of three years and an initial funding of ₹30,00,00,000, the cost of a Cray supercomputer.[7]
        
        A prototype computer was benchmarked at the 1990 Zurich Super-computing Show. It demonstrated that India had the second most powerful, publicly demonstrated, supercomputer in the world after the United States.[7][8]
        
        The final result of the effort was the PARAM 8000, released in 1991.[9]
        
        The National Centre for Software Technology (NCST), Electronic Research and Development Centre (ER&DC) and CEDTI were merged into C-DAC in 2003.[10][11]
